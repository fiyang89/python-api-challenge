# Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

## WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator

### Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

### Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship:
(Compute the linear regression for each relationship)

Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

## VacationPy
In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations.
